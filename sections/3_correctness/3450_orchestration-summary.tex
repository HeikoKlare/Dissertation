\section{Summary}

In this chapter, we have discussed how we can realize an application function for transformation networks.
We have motivated optimality as a desired property, which ensures that an application function always delivers consistent models if there is an order of the transformations that yields them. 
From this optimality notion, we have derived the central orchestration problem, for which we haven proven undecidability even when restricting transformation networks.
Finally, we have proposed strategies to reduce the cases in which no consistent models are found and an algorithm that executes transformations with a well-defined order and bound.
Rather than improving optimality, it ensures that in cases in which no consistent models can be derived at least some information can be provided that helps developers or users of transformations to identify why no consistent models were found.
We conclude this chapter with the following central insight.

\begin{insight}[Orchestration]
    The \emph{orchestration problem}, whether an orchestration of modular and independently developed transformations exists that restores consistency for given models and changes, is undecidable.
    We have shown that the problem stays undecidable even with impractical restrictions to the individual transformations, such that we need to accept undecidability of the problem.
    In consequence, every algorithm that realizes an application function for transformations can only implement a conservative approach to the orchestration problem.
    Due to this conservativeness, every algorithm will fail in cases in which actually an orchestration of the transformations exists that leads to consistent models.
    Thus, it is useful to find an algorithm that orchestrates the transformations in a way such that the state of executed transformations and generated changes can help the transformation developer or user to identify why the algorithm failed.
    This can be achieved with a strategy of iteratively restoring consistency, such that always a subset of the transformations for which consistency could be restored and a transformation for which it could not be restored anymore can be provided to ease reasoning about the cause for failing.
    We have proposed an algorithm that implements this strategy and is proven to fulfill the desired property.
