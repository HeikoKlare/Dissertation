\section{Achieving Synchronization} % of Bidirectional Transformations}
% Das Praktische Problem
\label{chap:synchronization:achieving}

\mnote{Synchronizing bidirectional transformation}
We have introduced the notion of synchronizing bidirectional transformations, which can be used within transformation networks in place of synchronizing transformations.
They are composed of two unidirectional consistency preservation rules, which fits to the way how transformations are specified in transformation languages.
In contrast to only being correct, as commonly required of transformations, they need to fulfill the notion of being partial-consistency-improving to be used instead of synchronizing transformations.

\mnote{Partial consistency improvement no canonically achievable}
The knowledge about this requirement, theoretically, gives a transformation developer the ability to define appropriate transformations to be used in transformation networks.
We have discussed that the requirement for transformations to be partial-consistency-improving is reasonable, as it reflect intuitive requirements to transformations to always restore more consistency than is violated by their execution.
There is, however, still no canonical way to fulfill that requirement.
It may be possible to define analyses for transformations or even appropriate transformation languages that guarantee the property by construction.
This could, however, even lead to severe restrictions in expressiveness if analyzability is the primary goal.
In addition, research about synchronizing concurrent changes (e.g.~\cite{hermann2012concurrentSynchronization-FASE,orejas2020IncrementalConcurrentSynchronization-FASE,xiong2013SynchronizingConcurrentUpdates-SoSym,xiong2009parallelUpdates-ICMT} already addresses a comparable problem.
Thus, we do not discuss or investigate such approaches in this thesis.

\mnote{Systematic avoidance of synchronization problems}
We leave it up to transformation developers to thoroughly define their transformations such that they fulfill the required property.
Having precise knowledge about the property that needs to be fulfilled by the transformations already provides a benefit regarding the baseline of using ordinary transformations in a transformation network without knowing how the transformations have to be improved to work properly.
In addition, we discuss a distinction of possible scenarios that can occur when changes need to be synchronized and come up with engineering considerations how to systematically deal with these scenarios.
We identify one essentially problematic scenario and propose a strategy to avoid that problem by proper construction of transformations.
In our evaluation in \autoref{chap:correctness_evaluation}, we will see that it is actually the only occurring and thus most relevant problem scenario that transformation developers have to deal with when developing synchronizing bidirectional transformations.


\subsection{Synchronization Scenarios}

\mnote{Inconsistency introduced by changes}
For the execution of synchronizing bidirectional transformations, we have assumed that inconsistencies are only introduced by changes.
Thus, defining a consistency preservation rule that processes changes in one model must consider that it has to deal with the situation that the other model has been changed as well.
Although this might intuitively lead to the expectation that distinguishing the different types of changes, such as element insertions and removals, helps to identify relevant scenarios, actually the modification of condition elements of the consistency relations rather than individual elements is relevant.

\mnote{No case distinction by models changes types}
If we process a change $\change{\metamodel{M}{1}}$ to model $\model{m}{1}$, and if $\model{m}{2}$ was changed by $\change{\metamodel{M}{2}}$ as well,
a consistency preservation rule $\consistencypreservationrule{}^{\rightarrow}$ from $\metamodel{M}{1}$ to $\metamodel{M}{2}$ of a synchronizing bidirectional transformation $\transformation{t}$ produces a change $\change{\metamodel{M}{2}}'$ in the execution of the synchronizing execution step $\function{SyncEx}_{\transformation{t}}^1$.
If we assume that $\change{\metamodel{M}{1}}$ performs a change that introduces a new condition element, $\consistencypreservationrule{}^{\rightarrow}$ is responsible for adding a corresponding element to $\change{\metamodel{M}{2}}(\model{m}{2})$ such that partial consistency between the two is improved and, in the best case, already restored to $1$.
$\consistencypreservationrule{}^{\rightarrow}$ must also consider the change $\change{\metamodel{M}{2}}$, which may have already added an appropriate corresponding element, such that adding a further one may reduce instead of improve partial consistency.
Adding a condition element to a model can, however, not only be the result of adding an element but also of different types of changes, such as also the change of an attribute or reference value.
In fact, it must only be considered that a condition element was added but not which kind of change introduced it.

% Die Kombination zweier Changes kann niemals dazu führen, dass ein Condition Element entfernt wird, was nicht eh entfernt worden wäre, da bereits beim Nicht-Vorhandensein eines Elementes aus dem Condition Element das Condition Element schon nicht mehr im Modell ist.
% Gleiches gilt für die Änderung eines Condition Element. Ein Condition Element ist genau eine Menge von Modellelementen. Entweder ein Change ändert dieses oder nicht, aber nicht erst eine Kombination von Änderungen kann dazu führen.
% Interessant ist die Erzeugung eines Condition Elementes, denn diese kann durch die Kombination mehrere Änderungen entstehen. Erst wenn alle Modellelemente innerhalb eines Condition Elementes erzeugt wurde induziert dies Konsistenzanforderungen.

\mnote{Case distinction fpr condition element change types}
We have already discussed in \autoref{chap:synchronization:gap:alignment} that the addition, removal, and change of condition elements are the relevant scenarios that can lead to consistency violations.
In case of adding a condition element, an appropriate corresponding element for it may be missing, such that no witness structure for consistency is given.
This requires an appropriate element to be added.
In case of removing a condition element, the element was corresponding to another one, which now has no corresponding element anymore.
This requires the corresponding condition element to be removed.
Changing a condition element can be seen as a modification of model elements such that they represent another condition element of the same condition, thus still belonging to the same consistency relation.
The consistency preservation rule must then update the corresponding condition element appropriately.

\mnote{Intuitive behavior ensuring partial consistency improvement}
This behavior is what consistency preservation rules are actually supposed to implement.
A bidirectional transformation with such preservation rules is inherently supposed to fulfill the property of being partial-consistency-improving, because the elements that have no corresponding elements due to a change are not part of the maximal consistent subsets before executing the consistency preservation rule.
After executing it, either the corresponding element is removed and thus the model size decreases, or a corresponding element is added and the size of the maximal consistent subsets improves.

\mnote{Interference of condition elements}
In addition to the above considerations, a transformation may be prevented from being partial-consistency-improving, because the addition or removal of a condition element to improve consistency affects further condition elements.
This can occur because these condition elements overlap, i.e., some model elements may be part of several condition elements.
Then, if all elements of a condition element are removed, the other condition element is not present anymore as well.
A consistency preservation rule must thus be carefully defined such that removing one condition element does not lead to the removal of another one, which was actually part of the maximal consistent subset.
Otherwise, the consistency preservation rule introduces a new violation of consistency.
The same applies to the scenario of adding condition elements. 
If the addition leads to the introduction of an additional condition element, because some objects in the added condition element together with other existing objects form a condition element of another consistency relation, this introduces an inconsistency if no corresponding element exists yet, thus reducing partial consistency.
If the previously existing elements within the induced condition element were part of the maximal consistent subset, the consistency preservation rule is actually not correct.
If the models were consistent before and only the change to one model is performed, correctness of the consistency preservation rule requires the result to be consistent.
However, it introduces a further condition element that has no corresponding element, thus the result is not consistent.
If, on the other hand, the previously existing elements within the induced condition element were not part of the maximal consistent subset, it is fine that these elements are still inconsistent, as the consistency preservation rules still need to process them anyway.
These problems are comparable to those of fine-grained transformation rules, as discussed in \autoref{chap:correctness:finegrained:relations}, which need to be defined such that one rule does not lead to the violation of the consistency relation of another.

\mnote{Conflicts between condition element changes}
The previous considerations reflected the case that only one model was changed.
If the other model was changed as well, the combinations of changes can lead to specific situations that have to be handled differently.
We therefore distinguish the addition, removal, and change of a condition element to be processed by the consistency preservation rule and discuss what conflicts may occur by changes performed in the other model.
Changes of condition elements are, in practice, traced by the usage of trace models that store trace links between corresponding elements.
It can be seen as a representation of the witness structure we have defined for identifying consistency.
If elements become changed, the trace links still exist and indicate which corresponding elements need to be adapted.
According to the defined notion of consistency, these potential conflicts are just based on the question whether appropriate condition elements exist or not.
\begin{properdescription}
    \item[Addition:] Whenever a condition element is added to one model, it must be ensured that a corresponding condition element in the other model exists.
    In the case that both models were consistent before, the corresponding element cannot already be present in the other model and thus has to be added.
    If the other model has been changed, an appropriate corresponding element may have already been added.
    That scenario has to be explicitly considered to avoid a duplicate creation of the condition element, which then may lead to a violation of consistency that cannot be resolved by adding further elements anymore.
    \item[Removal:] Whenever a condition element is removed from one model, the corresponding condition element must be removed from the other model, as otherwise its corresponding element is missing, which would violate consistency.
    If the models were consistent before, it is guaranteed that the corresponding element exists and can thus be removed.
    If the corresponding condition element is not present, because it was already removed from the other model, the element cannot but also does not need to be removed anymore.
    It must only be considered that the existence of the corresponding element cannot be assumed.
    \item[Change:] When model elements are changed such that they represent a different condition element of the same condition as before, they usually also require the corresponding element to be updated to represent the condition element of an applicable consistency relation pair.
    If the corresponding element was removed, the consistency preservation rule in the opposite direction will remove the changed condition element anyway to restore consistency.
    Thus, the consistency preservation rule must only consider that the corresponding element may have been removed but does not need to perform changes.
    If the corresponding element was changed, which is identified by the trace model still containing a link to a changed element, it must be adapted such that both elements form a consistency relation pair again.
    The modification to the corresponding element will then be propagated back by the opposite consistency preservation rule.
\end{properdescription}

\mnote{Problematic scenario is duplicate addition of condition elements}
In summary, we have to deal with two specific situations that can occur when the target model of a consistency preservation rule may have been changed.
First, when adding condition elements, their corresponding elements may already exist in the other model.
Second, when removing condition elements, their corresponding elements may have already been removed from the other model.
While the second scenario is easy to handle by doing nothing whenever the corresponding elements of removed elements are not present anymore, the first scenario requires an approach to identify whether corresponding elements already exist.
While existing corresponding elements can be retrieved from a trace model, no trace links exist for these newly created elements.
In the following, we thus discuss an approach to find corresponding elements.

% Inkonsistenzen werden dadurch eingeführt, dass neue Condition Elements hinzugefügt werden, für die es keine eindeutigen korrespondierenden Elemente gibt, d.h. keine Witness-Struktur aufgebaut werden kann.
% Dies ist der Fall sein, wenn Elemente erzeugt werden, um notwendige Konsistenz herzustellen, dadurch aber neue Condition Elements induziert werden, die wieder Konsistenzhaltung bedürfen.
% Entsteht das neue Condition Element aus Modellelementen, die alle im partiell konsistenten Teilmodell liegen, dann ist die CPR falsch.
% Für dieses partielle Modell, welches vorher konsistent war, und die zugehörige Änderung müsste die CPR gem. Definition Korrektheit ein konsistentes Ergebnis produzieren, kann also keine Condition Elements in m2 induzieren, die keine korrespondierenden Elemente in m2 haben, da die Modelle dann nicht konsistent sind.
% Entsteht das neue Condition Element mit Modellelementen, die nicht im partiell konsistenten Teilmodell liegen, ist das okay, da hierfür keine Konsistenz verlangt ist.

% Probleme mit denen CPR durch nebenläufige Änderung umgehen können muss:
% 1. Neue Condition Elements sind bereits vorhanden
% 2. Condition Elements wurden auf Zielseite modifiziert
% 3. Condition Elements wurden auf Zielseite gelöscht

% 1. Das müssen wir herausfinden, siehe Trace-Modell
% 2. CPR muss wissen, welche korrespondierenden Elemente es vorher gab und diese auf der Zielseite entsprechend anpassen. Im Prinzip muss die CPR nur betrachten, welche Bedingungen die Elemente erfüllen müssen und diese wiederherstellen. Hier müssen aber nur die Änderungen in beide Richtungen entsprechend übertragen werden.
% 3. CPR muss nichts tun, da durch das Löschen auf der Zielseite auch ein Löschen auf der Quellseite nötig ist, um wieder eine passende Witness-Struktur zu induzieren. Das kann nur die gegenläufige CPR sicherstellen.

% Konsequenz: 1. ist der Fall, den wir uns noch genauer anschauen müssen.

% % ZUSAMMENFASSUNG DER SZENARIEN BEI BEARBEITUNG VON MODIFIZIERTEM M2
% Mögliche Situationen wenn wir an 1->2 statt m2 direkt d2(m2) übergeben:
% 1. d2(m2) ändert Elemente in einem Condition Element, die 1->2 auch ändern muss. Dann ändert 1->2 einfach partiell die Elemente, und 2->1 macht dann nachher den Rest (nachweisen, dass das geht)
% 2. d2(m2) fügt neue Condition Elemente hinzu: Unproblematisch, wenn sie nicht mit Elemente in d1(m1) zusammenhängen (d.h. keine Witness-Struktur zwischen d1(m1) und d2(m2) die Elemente verbindet), dann werden sie von 2->1 bearbeitet. Wenn sie mit Element in d1(m1) zusammenhängen (also es eine Witness-Struktur gibt, die Elemente verbindet, auch wenn das noch nicht im Trace-Modell steht), muss hier das Matching passieren! Hier ist natürlich von einer passenden Granularität der Konsistenzrelationen auszugehen. Bspw. kann es reichen, dass eine eine Person/Resident/... mit einem passenden Namen vorhanden ist, ohne dass irgendwelche anderen Werte übereinstimmen (das könnte dann in weiteren Konsistenzrelationen stehen). Dann gäbe es z.B. eine Konsistenzrelation, die angibt, dass für jede Person ein Resident mit dem gleichen Namen vorhanden sein muss, und dann noch eine die beschreibt, dass für Person/Resident-Paare mit dem gleichen Namen auch andere Attribute passend abgebildet werden müssen. Dies ist aber in Transformationssprachen eh implizit so realisiert und lässt sich mit unserem Formalismus für feingranulare Konsistenzrelationen problemlos abbilden.
% 3. d2(m2) entfernt Condition Elemente: Unproblematisch, wenn die Verarbeitung von d1 nicht auf die entsprechenden Condition Elemente zugreifen muss, also nichts in m1 geändert wurde was zu gelöschten Elementen in d2(m2) korrespondiert. Ansonsten können keine Informationen übertragen werden, da die Witness-Struktur nicht mehr gilt, also macht 1->2 an der Stelle nicht weiter und 2->1 übernimmt den Abbau der Elemente in m1.


\subsection{Identification of Existing Corresponding Elements}
\label{chap:synchronization:achieving:identification}

\mnote{Identification of corresponding elements}
Whenever a condition element is added, which requires a corresponding element to exist in the other model, the consistency preservation rule will usually create appropriate elements in the other model.
This is due to the reason that in the case when the target model has not been modified as well, these elements cannot already exist.
In the synchronization case, however, the change to the target model may have already introduced those elements, thus it is necessary to find them to avoid their duplicate creation.

\mnote{Trace links}
In previous work~\owncite{klare2019icmt}, we have proposed a strategy to identify such corresponding elements.
Transformation languages usually use trace models to store the information about which elements are corresponding to each other.
Thus, whenever the consistency preservation rule in the opposite direction added the element whose addition is currently processed, a trace link already exists.
When the corresponding elements were created by different transformations, however, there will not be a trace link between them.

\mnote{Transitive trace links}
An intuitive attempt would be to use the trace links of the other transformations across which they were created.
For example, if for a \gls{PCM} component a \gls{UML} class is created, and for this \gls{UML} class a Java class is created, then there are trace links between the \gls{PCM} component and the \gls{UML} class, as well as between the \gls{UML} class and the Java class.
Synchronizing the addition of the \gls{PCM} component and the Java class should not result in a redundant addition of a further Java class.
Resolving the existing trace links transitively is, however, not a solution.
In this case, a unique one-to-one mapping exists that actually traces the \gls{PCM} component to the corresponding Java class.
It would, however, also be possible that a \gls{PCM} component has trace links to several elements in the Java model across the \gls{UML}.
If those elements are even multiple classes, such as one public and one internal utility class, but the consistency relation between \gls{PCM} and Java only requires one Java class for a \gls{PCM} component, it would be unclear which to select.

\mnote{Semantics of trace links}
Transformation languages usually tag trace links with additional information, for example, containing the transformation rule that created them, to distinguish links to instances of the same class.
Since these tags are created by other transformations, considering them would violate our assumption of independent development and modular reuse of transformations.
Even worse, it could also be the case that another third class is required by the consistency relation between \gls{PCM} and Java.
Finally, it is up to the actual consistency relation to define when elements are to be considered corresponding, because there may be more semantics beyond the types of the elements related by a trace link that determines how they belong together.

\mnote{Information for identifying corresponding elements is given in consistency relation}
Thus, whether corresponding elements already exist cannot be identified by transitively resolving trace links of other transformations but only by considering the two involved models.
The information to identify whether elements can be considered corresponding is precisely given in the consistency relation.
For example, if the relation specifies that, in a very simplified notion, a \gls{PCM} component is consistent to all Java classes that have the same name, no matter what implementation the class contains, then if any class with the name of the \gls{PCM} component is found in the Java code, it can be considered corresponding.

\mnote{Corresponding element identification level}
We come up with the following three levels of identifying corresponding elements.
\begin{properdescription}
    \item[Explicit Unique:] The information that elements correspond is unique and represented explicitly, e.g., within a trace model.
    \item[Implicit Unique:] The information that elements correspond is unique but represented implicitly, e.g., in terms of key information within the models, such as element names.
    \item[Non-Unique:] Without unique information, heuristics based on ambiguous information or transitive resolution of indirect trace links must be used.
\end{properdescription}

\mnote{Explicit and unique identification by trace links}
In the best case, a trace link already exists between the corresponding elements. This can be because a consistency preservation rule in one direction created the corresponding element and added the trace link. Then the consistency preservation rule in the other direction processes the change that introduced the corresponding element but now can already retrieve the trace link.
This is what we call \emph{explicit unique} information, because the information is represented explicitly and unambiguously in the trace model.

\mnote{Implicit and unique identification by key information}
If no trace link exists, like in the synchronization scenario, the information specified in consistency relations to identify corresponding elements needs to be used.
This can be considered key information, because the information is used as the key to identify corresponding elements.
To this end, the model has to be queried for elements with the given information.
The transformation language \gls{QVTR} already provides a language construct to specify such key information within transformation rules~\cite[Sec.~7.10.2.]{qvt}.
We call this information \emph{implicit unique}, because elements can be unambiguously identified by implict information within the models.
Note that in case that multiple corresponding elements match the key information, any of them can be selected.
It is up to the consistency preservation rule for the other direction to add further elements such that corresponding elements for all of them are added, such that a valid witness structure is induced.

\mnote{Non-unique identification by heuristics}
In the worst case, no unique information is given.
Precisely following our formalism, this scenario can never occur, because each consistency relation defines the necessary key information.
Thus, this scenario can only occur in practice with a relaxed notion of consistency.
This can be the case when for an element a corresponding one is always created, containing some related information, but no unique information to identify that the two are corresponding is given.
In that case, only trace links identify that the elements are corresponding.
Thus, if other transformations created the elements and thus no direct trace link exists, it is impossible to identify that these elements shall be corresponding.
Since no information to identify that the elements should be corresponding is present anyway and since this requires a relaxed consistency notion, we assume this scenario unlikely to occur at all and did not face it in our evaluation at any time.
If, nevertheless, this scenario occurs, only heuristics can be used to identify corresponding elements without any guarantee of success.
It would also be possible to involve the developer and let him decide whether an element should be considered corresponding.

\begin{algorithm}
    \input{algorithms/correctness/synchronization/find_corresponding_elements.tex}
    \caption[Retrieval of corresponding elements]{Retrieval of corresponding elements.}
    \label{algo:synchronization:find_corresponding_elements}
\end{algorithm}

\mnote{Extension of ordinary transformations}
In summary, it is necessary that transformation developers use key information for identifying corresponding elements based on \emph{implicit unique} information in addition to the usage of \emph{explicit unique} information in terms of trace links.
In case that corresponding elements are found based on implicit unique information, they need to establish a trace link for the elements.
We define this behavior in \autoref{algo:synchronization:find_corresponding_elements}, which is an extended version of an algorithm~\owncite[Alg.~1]{saglam2020ma} defined in the Master's thesis of \citeauthor{saglam2020ma}, which was supervised by the author of this thesis, and adapted to our formalism.

\mnote{Algorithm for finding corresponding elements}
\autoref{algo:synchronization:find_corresponding_elements} receives the consistency relation for which corresponding elements shall be found, the condition element $\conditionelement{c}{l}$ of the condition $\condition{c}{l,\consistencyrelation{CR}{}}$ that was added to model $\model{m}{1}$ for which corresponding elements shall be found or created, the model $\model{m}{2}$ in which the corresponding elements shall be searched, and the trace model $\model{m}{\mathvariable{traces}} \subseteq \mathcal{P}(\model{m}{1}) \times \mathcal{P}(\model{m}{2})$ containing pairs of elements in $\model{m}{1}$ and $\model{m}{2}$, which represents a combination of witness structures for consistency relations between metamodels $\metamodel{M}{1}$ and $\metamodel{M}{2}$. 
The algorithm first retrieves all corresponding elements for the condition element from the trace model and then, in \autoref{algo:synchronization:find_corresponding_elements:line:explicit}, checks whether any of the corresponding elements according to the trace model is a corresponding element in $\consistencyrelation{CR}{}$.
If this is the case, a corresponding element $\conditionelement{c}{r}$ is found and the procedure returns $\conditionelement{c}{r}$.
Otherwise, model $\model{m}{2}$ is browsed for the existence of a corresponding element in the loop starting in \autoref{algo:synchronization:find_corresponding_elements:line:implicit}.
It considers all subset of $\model{m}{2}$, i.e., the potency set $\mathcal{P}(\model{m}{2})$, of which each could be such a corresponding element.
If one of them is corresponding according to $\consistencyrelation{CR}{}$, then the pair $\tupled{\conditionelement{c}{l},\conditionelement{c}{r}}$ is added to the trace model $\model{m}{\mathvariable{traces}}$ as an appropriate trace link and the procedure returns the found element $\conditionelement{c}{r}$.
If no such element is found, the procedure returns $\bot$ to indicate that no corresponding element is found and thus has to be created by the consistency preservation rule.

\mnote{Efficient identification by key}
The loop in \autoref{algo:synchronization:find_corresponding_elements:line:implicit} is defined in a rather inefficient way but describes its purpose in the most general way.
In a practical implementation, it may not consider every subset of the model $\model{m}{2}$ but instead retrieve all candidate elements, for example, by filtering model elements by their class.
Depending on the modeling framework, different possibilities to efficiently find specific elements can be used.
The implementation of the \gls{EMF}, for example, provides functions that yield all instances of a specific class.

\mnote{Application situation of algorithm}
The transformation developer has to apply this algorithm every time he or she specifies the creation of corresponding elements due to a change adding a condition element.
This ensures that applying the bidirectional transformation to the synchronization case properly handles the situation that a change has already created the corresponding elements to ensure that the resulting transformation is partial-consistency-improving.

\mnote{Partial consistency improvement not proven}
In contrast to the insights of the previous sections, the engineering considerations we have made in this section are not completely formally founded and proven.
We have not proven that if a transformation developer follows the discussed rules for the construction of consistency preservation rules and applies the $\function{FindCorresponding}$ function whenever condition elements are created leads to a synchronizing bidirectional transformation, i.e., a bidirectional transformation that fulfills the requirement of being partial-consistency-improving.
We derived the insights from thorough argumentation but further validate them in the evaluation in \autoref{chap:correctness_evaluation}.


\subsection{Model Changes To Condition Element Changes}
\label{chap:synchronization:achieving:changes}

\mnote{Condition element changes induced by model element changes}
The previous discussions distinguished different change scenarios for condition elements, as those are relevant when considering the synchronization case of bidirectional transformations.
A transformation does, however, not receive changes of condition elements but changes of actual model elements.
These then eventually lead to the addition, removal, or change of a condition element.
Thus, a transformation developer needs to decide which model changes introduce which modifications of condition elements to determine appropriate behavior of the consistency preservation rules.

    \label{fig:synchronization:change_feature_model}
\end{figure}


\mnote{Possibel change types}
The possible types of model changes are induced by the used modeling formalism, as the \metametamodel defines which types of changes can be performed in models.
Our modeling formalism introduced in \autoref{chap:networks:models} is conforming to the \gls{EMOF}, which is why we consider changes in \gls{EMOF}- and Ecore-based models.
\citeauthor{kramer2017a} proposes feature models that express all kinds of possible changes in \gls{EMOF}-based models~\cite[Fig. 5.2]{kramer2017a} and Ecore-based models~\cite[Fig.~5.3]{kramer2017a}.
Since both are rather similar (see \autoref{chap:foundations:formalisms:ecore}), we focus on Ecore as the practically realized modeling formalism.
%\mnote{Corrections of existing feature model}
We depict a modified version of the feature model for changes in Ecore-based models in \autoref{fig:synchronization:change_feature_model}.
In comparison to the original model~\cite[Fig. 5.3]{kramer2017a}, we have made the following changes.
\begin{properdescription}
    \item[No Compound Changes:] We do not consider compound changes, because they are simply compositions of atomic changes and thus do not need to be considered explicitly.
    \item[No Permutation:] We removed the \emph{Permutation} feature, because it can be considered as a compound change of a subtractive and additive multi-valued feature change. Whether or not permutation rather than the removal and addition is relevant is up to the interpretation of the change sequence and is comparable to moving an element from one reference to another, which is also modeled as a compound change.
    \item[Mandatory Content:] We made the \emph{Content} feature mandatory, because every change is either additive or subtractive due to the removal of the permutation.
    \item[Constraints Reduction:] We reduced the constraints to those that are still relevant after performing the previously discussed changes.
    \item[Error Correction:] We fixed an error in the constraints of the original model. They required a \emph{Create} change of a root element to be subtractive, which does not make sense. We corrected that error by simplification.
\end{properdescription}

\mnote{Case distinction of model changes}
The set of all possible change types in Ecore-based models is given by enumerating all valid configurations of the feature model.
We discuss for each of the resulting changes the types of condition element changes it may induce.
\begin{properdescription}
    \item[Additive Root Change (Possibly Create):] Adding a root element can lead to the addition of a condition element, which consists only of this root element. It will not induce a change or removal of a condition element.
    \item[Subtractive Root Change (Possibly Delete):] The removal of a root element can lead to the removal of a condition element, which involves the root element. Since it removes an element, it can neither lead to a change nor to an addition of a condition element.
    \item[Single-Valued Attribute Change:] Changing an attribute can lead to either an addition, removal, or change of a condition element. The change may lead to an element that now, potentially together with other elements, forms a condition element. It may also lead to a different condition element of the same condition, e.g., by renaming an element. Finally, it can also lead to an element that is not present in a condition anymore. This applies no matter whether the attribute change is only additive, only subtractive, or both, thus whether it adds, removes, or replaces the attribute value.
    \item[Additive Multi-Valued Attribute Change:] Adding a value to a multi-valued attribute can lead to either an addition, removal, or change of a condition element. The change can lead to the situation that the element is now part of a condition element, is not part of a condition element anymore, or that it represents a different condition element of the same condition and is thus comparable to the change of a single-valued attribute.
    \item[Subtractive Multi-Valued Attribute Change:] Removing a value from a multi-valued attribute can lead to either an addition, removal, or change of a condition element, due to the same reasons as the additive multi-valued attribute change.
    \item[Single-Valued Reference Change (Possibly Create/Delete):] The change of a reference can lead to either an addition, removal, or change of a condition element, due to the same reasons as for single-valued attribute changes. This is even independent from whether the added or removed element is created or deleted, respectively.
    \item[Additive Multi-Valued Reference Change (Possibly Create):] The addition of a value to a multi-valued reference can lead to either an addition, removal, or change of a condition element, due to the same reasons as for adding an attribute to a multi-valued attribute. Like for single-valued reference changes, this is even independent from whether the element was created or already existed before.
    \item[Subtractive Multi-Valued Reference Change (Possibly Delete):] If a value is removed from a multi-valued reference, this can lead to either an addition, removal, or change of a condition element, due to the same reasons as for removing an attribute from a multi-valued attribute. Like for single-valued reference changes and additive multi-valued reference changes, this is even independent from whether the element was created or already existed before.
\end{properdescription}

\mnote{Relation between condition and model element changes}
It is easy to see that except for root changes each type of model change can lead to any kind of condition element change, because almost every type of change can lead to the situation that model elements form a condition element or do not form a condition element anymore.
There may be a missing reference or attribute value, or even a superfluous reference or attribute value, after whose change the model elements form a condition element.
This conforms to the notion of creating a corresponding element whenever all conditions for some model elements are fulfilled in the \gls{QVTR}-like \emph{Mappings Language}~\cite[p.~283]{kramer2017a}.
Since all types of changes can lead to the fulfillment of conditions, the addition of a condition element is not tied to a specific type of change.

\mnote{Relevant changes restriction depending on consistency relation}
Depending on the specific consistency relation, there may, however, be some change types that are not relevant in that case.
For example, if a consistency relation puts two model elements having only reference values into relation, then no attribute change will lead to the addition, removal, or change of a condition element of that consistency relation.

\mnote{Application cases for corresponding elements identification}
The specific case of identifying corresponding elements during synchronization discussed in the previous subsection needs to be considered whenever a condition element was added.
Since this can occur because of any type of change except for removals of root elements, we cannot make any general restrictions on the types of model changes that need to be explicitly considered for the synchronization case.
The transformation developer must decide after which changes a condition element may be created, independent from whether corresponding elements may already exist or not.
Thus, he or she makes this decision anyway and must only extend the existing logic for finding corresponding elements according to the given algorithm.
