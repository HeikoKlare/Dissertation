\section{Orchestration Algorithm}

Correctness of the proposed strategy is proven.
Usefulness of the strategy to identify the cause for the network failing to resolve a change can, however, not be proven easily.
Showing it empirically requires high effort.
We thus provide a scenario-based discussion showing that the strategy is beneficial in reasonable cases.

\subsection{Threats to Validity}


\subsection{Limitations}
Well-defined design property only fulfilled for reactive converging transformations, whose property cannot easily be guaranteed nor analyzed.
We argued why this is still reasonable but some property that gives further guarantees and is at least analyzable would even be butter, but it questionable whether such a property will be ensured anyway, as it can easily restrict expressiveness of transformations too much, as discussed in that chapter for other property that restrict expressiveness.
