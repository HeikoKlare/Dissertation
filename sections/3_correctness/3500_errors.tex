\mnote{Discuss error as the result of failing in achieving correctness}
In the previous chapters, we have introduced a notion of correctness for transformation networks and discussed how we can achieve or analyze different kinds of correctness for the different artifacts of a transformation network, namely consistency relations, consistency preservation rules, and the application function.
It may, however, easily occur that transformation developers define transformations that do not adhere to all these kinds of correctness, be it because of missing knowledge about them or by accident.

\mnote{Proposal for specification levels and categorization of errors}
In this chapter, we discuss what may happen if correctness was not achieved.
The possible types of errors that can occur depend on the abstraction level at which the specification is performed. 
This depends on existing knowledge, i.e., whether the transformation is to be used in a transformation network or even in which network it is to be used, but also on the abstraction provided by the formalism or language to specify a transformation or transformation network in.
We first propose a distinction of such knowledge levels for the specification of transformation networks.
We then systematically derive a categorization of potential \emph{failures}, i.e., the unwanted results the application algorithm may yield, the \emph{faults} that led to the failures, i.e., the errors in the implementation of the transformation, and finally the causing \emph{mistakes}, i.e., the errors made by a developer due to his or her knowledge that led to an implementation fault.
Finally, we discuss how the possible types of mistakes, faults, and failures can be detected or avoided and how this relates to the correctness notions and the introduced approaches to achieve correctness.

\mnote{Subordinate contributions}
This chapter thus constitutes our contribution \autoref{contrib:correctness:errors}, which consists of three subordinate contributions: a separation of knowledge-dependent specification levels for transformation networks; a categorization of potential errors in transformation networks; and a discussion of the possibilities to detect and avoid errors with respect to the discussed correctness notions and measures to achieve them.
It answers the following research question:

\researchquestionrepeat{rq:correctness:errors}

\mnote{Benefits of contributions}
As the central goal of this chapter, we categorize the possible types of errors to derive systematic knowledge about mistakes that can be made and failures that can arise from them.
First, this helps transformations developers to identify the reasons for arising failures.
Second, it allows us to identify which relevant errors we can avoid or detect with the approaches proposed in the previous chapters and how relevant the problems that we solve with them are.
The latter will be part of our subsequent evaluation at case studies.

\mnote{Publication of contributions}
Several of the insights regarding errors in transformation networks are results of the two Master's theses by \textowncite{syma2018ma} and \textowncite{saglam2020ma}, who investigated errors that occurred when combining independently developed transformations in two case studies.
Essential results from the former thesis were published in previous work~\owncite{klare2019icmt} and will be presented in the following sections in revised form.
