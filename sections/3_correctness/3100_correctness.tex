\mnote{Chapter goals}
In this chapter, we will first discuss a rather informal notion of consistency and its preservation. It is supposed to discuss the different dimensions in which consistency and its preservation can be considered to then discuss how \emph{correctness} can be reasonably defined.
After identifying the correctness notion that is relevant in the context of our work, we define a suitable formal notion of consistency.
We finally formally define correctness for that notion of consistency.

\mnote{Contributions}
This chapter thus constitutes our contribution \autoref{contrib:correctness:notion}, which is composed of three subordinate contributions: a discussion of consistency notions, a discussion and determination of correctness notions for consistency specifications, and finally a formalization of a relevant correctness notion.
It answers the following research question:

\mnote{Publication of results}
Parts of the contributions in this chapter have already been published in \owncite{klare2020Vitruv-JSS} and \owncite{klare2018docsym}.
In \owncite{klare2020Vitruv-JSS}, we have used a simplified version of the formalization that we introduce in this chapter.
In \owncite{klare2018docsym}, we especially motivate and informally derive the correctness notion that we formalize in the following and give an overview of the goal regarding correctness of transformation networks.
