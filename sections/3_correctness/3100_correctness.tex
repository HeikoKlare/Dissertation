%% PLANNED STRUCTURE:
% Introduce consistency, preservation, app function Informally
% Discuss notions of correctness and identify what we are interested in
% Provide an appropriate formalism to describe that
% Derive research questions from the formalization (compatibility, synchronization, orchestration, probability of errors)

In this chapter, we will first discuss a rather informal notion of consistency and its preservation. It is supposed to discuss the different dimensions in which consistency and its preservation can be considered to then discuss how \emph{correctness} can be reasonably defined.
After identifying the correctness notion that is relevant in the context of our work, we define a suitable formal notion of consistency.
We then formally define correctness for that notion of consistency.
This chapter thus constitutes our contribution \contributionref{contrib:correctness:notion}, which is composed of three subordinate contributions: a discussion of consistency notions, a discussion and determination of correctness notions for consistency specifications, and finally a formalization of a relevant correctness notion.
It answers the following research question:
