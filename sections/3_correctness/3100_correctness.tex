\mnote{Chapter goals}
In this chapter, we first discuss a rather informal notion of consistency and its preservation. It is supposed to describe the different dimensions in which consistency and its preservation can be considered to then discuss how \emph{correctness} can be reasonably defined.
After identifying the correctness notion that is relevant in the context of our work, we define a suitable formal notion of consistency.
We formally define correctness of different artifacts relevant for that notion of consistency.
Finally, we present a refined notion of consistency, which we do not require for the initial overview, but which we later use for several detailed considerations.

\mnote{Contributions}
This chapter thus constitutes our contribution \autoref{contrib:correctness:notion}, which is composed of four subordinate contributions: a discussion of consistency notions; a discussion and determination of correctness notions for consistency specifications; a formalization of a relevant correctness notion; and finally a refinement of our consistency notion for later detailed considerations.
It answers the following research question:

\mnote{Publication of contributions}
Parts of the contributions in this chapter have already been published in previous work~\owncite{klare2018docsym, klare2020Vitruv-JSS,klare2020compatibility-report}.
We have motivated and informally derived the correctness notion that we formalize in the following and gave an overview of the goal regarding correctness of transformation networks~\owncite{klare2018docsym}.
We have used a simplified version of the formalization that we introduce in this chapter and especially identified the challenge of orchestration~\owncite{klare2020Vitruv-JSS}, which is central for the formalization of transformation networks.
Finally, we have discussed compatibility and introduced the fine-grained consistency notion~\owncite{klare2020compatibility-report}, which is required for detailed statements about compatibility.
