\mnote{Consistency relations correct by construction}
We have defined in \autoref{chap:correctness} that transformations, from which we construct transformation networks, are composed of consistency relations and consistency preservation rules that preserve them.
We focus on binary relations and according preservation rules, which relate two metamodels.
While we have precisely defined correctness of transformations and their orchestration in a network, we found that the underlying consistency relations themselves can, from a theoretical perspective, be considered correct by construction, as there is no other artifact (be it explicit or only implicitly given) with respect to which it has to be correct.
Since we assume transformations to be developed independently and reused in a modular way, we can especially not assume a monolithic consistency relation to which the modular consistency relations must be correct (see \autoref{chap:correctness:notions_correctness:dimensions}).

\mnote{Contradictions in relations}
We have, however, already given examples for cases in which binary consistency relations are somehow contradictory.
This is the case if the developers of individual transformations have different, conflicting notions of consistency between the metamodels.
In the worst case, this can lead to the situation that no single tuple of models would be considered consistent to a set of binary consistency relations, which is obviously unwanted behavior.
We have discussed an abstract example for that case already in \autoref{chap:correctness:notions_correctness:relations}.

\mnote{Intuitive compatibility in running example}
We recapture the running example defined in \autoref{fig:networks:three_persons_example} and extend it with alternatives for two of the binary consistency relations in \autoref{fig:compatibility:three_persons_example_extended}.
The example contains three pairwise consistency relations between persons, employees and residents.
They are defined in a way such that none of them can be omitted, because each pair shares a unique overlap in their attributes.
In that example, the consistency relations $\consistencyrelation{CR}{PE}, \consistencyrelation{CR}{PR}$ and $\consistencyrelation{CR}{ER}$ (as well as their transposed) are fulfilled if for each person (and each employee and resident analogously) in the models exactly one employee and one resident exist that fulfill the defined relations for names and other attributes.
According to our notion of consistency relations (\autoref{def:consistencyrelation}), it is essential that always only one such corresponding element exists, e.g., that no two employees with different name capitalizations fulfilling the relation to a single resident exist.
Intuitively, these consistency relations are \emph{compatible}, as they lead to a reasonable set of model tuples that are considered consistent.

\mnote{Intuitive incompatibility in modified running example}
In contrast, considering $\consistencyrelation{CR}{PR}'$ instead of $\consistencyrelation{CR}{PR}$, the relations can never be fulfilled, because the concatenation of $\mathvariable{firstname}$ and $\mathvariable{lastname}$ from person to employee and from person to resident is conflicting.
The relation between employees and persons assumes $\mathvariable{firstname}$ and $\mathvariable{lastname}$ to be concatenated in the same order, whereas the relation between residents and persons assumes them to be concatenated vice versa and separated by a comma.
Fulfilling these relations would require an infinitely large model, as the cycle of the relations requires for each person, employee and resident others with $\mathvariable{firstname}$ and $\mathvariable{lastname}$ swapped and extended with a comma to exist.
As finite models cannot fulfill this, the set of consistent model tuples would be empty.

\mnote{Further incompatibility in modified running example}
In addition, considering consistency relation $\consistencyrelation{CR}{ER}'$ instead of $\consistencyrelation{CR}{ER}$, no models containing residents with a name not written in lowercase can be consistent to all relations, as depicted in the example in \autoref{fig:compatibility:intuitive_incompatibility}, which, for reasons of simplicity, omits all other attributes than the names.
A resident with a non-lowercase name requires a person with equally capitalized first and last name to exist.
This, in consequence requires an employee with an equally capitalized name to exist.
The relation $\consistencyrelation{CR}{ER}'$ now requires a resident with the name written in lowercase to exist, which, again, requires a person with the lowercase name to exist.
This, in turn, requires an employee with the lowercase name to exist as well.
In consequence, the resident with the lowercase name would correspond to both the employee with the original and the lowercase name, whereas the resident with the original name does not correspond to any employee.
Since there is no witness structure with a unique mapping of corresponding elements, as also reflected in \autoref{fig:correctness:consistency_example}, such models cannot be consistent to the consistency relations.
More intuitively speaking, it is impossible to find an employee that fulfills the consistency relation $\consistencyrelation{CR}{ER}'$ for a resident with a non-lowercase name.
This is what we will call and later precisely define as an \emph{incompatibility} of the consistency relations, as they define constraints that cannot be fulfilled at the same time.
This can always occur if there is a cycle in the graph induced by the combined consistency relations.

\mnote{Incompatibilities affect consistency preservation}
Such incompatibilities are unwanted, as they indicate that developers have different, contradictory notions of consistency.
Additionally, they can easily result in transformations that do not yield consistent models or for which finding an orchestration that yields conistent models becomes unnecessarily difficult.
For that reason, we first discuss scenarios to identify an intuitive notion of \emph{compatibility}, which we then transfer into a formal notion.
Afterwards, we develop a formal, inductive approach to prove compatibility of relations, for which we prove correctness.
We then derive a practical approach for the transformation language \gls{QVTR}.
The approach is based on the insight that consistency relations forming a specific kind of tree structure are compatible and that removing a specific kind of redundant relations preserves compatibility.
This chapter thus constitutes our contribution \autoref{contrib:correctness:compatibility}, which consists of four subordinate contributions: a discussion of compatibility notions; a formal definition of one such notion; a formal approach to prove compatibility; and finally a practical realization of that approach.
It answers the following research question:

\researchquestionrepeat{rq:correctness:compatibility}

\mnote{Provability of compatibility}
We will see that it is in general not possible to prove that transformations are incompatible if the language, in which the relations are described, is undecidable, such as \gls{QVTR}.
We can, however, at least conservatively validate compatibility of transformations.
Thus, if our approach proves compatibility, the transformations are actually compatible, but not vice versa.
This enables transformation developers to validate compatibility of their transformations both on-the-fly during transformation development, if developed for a specific scenario, or a posteriori during their combination, according to the scenarios introduced in \autoref{chap:networks:specification_process}.
Especially in the first scenario, developers can immediately react to the introduction of incompatibilities during transformation development.

\mnote{Publication of contributions}
We have published central contributions of this chapter, in particular the formal and the practical approach for validating compatibility, in previous work~\owncite{klare2020compatibility-report}.
Parts of some sections of this chapter are also literally taken from that publication, which we will further indicate in the respective sections.
The practical approach has been developed in the Master's thesis of \textcite{pepin2019ma}, which was supervised by the author of this thesis.
