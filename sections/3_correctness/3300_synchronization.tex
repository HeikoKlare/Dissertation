\mnote{Transformation correctness}
Transformations are the central artifacts of which a transformation network is composed.
We have introduced them as \emph{synchronizing transformations} in \autoref{def:synchronizingtransformation}, which are combinations of consistency relations with a consistency preservation rules that preserves them.
Correctness of such a transformation was then defined as the property of the consistency preservation rule to preserve consistency of given models according to the consistency relations (cf.\ \autoref{def:synchronizingtransformationcorrectness}).
In theory, a correct transformation can simply be achieved by adhering to that definition.

%Even if we consider that one may only define a consistency preservation rule, which then induces the consistency relation as its image, thus being correct by construction, the rule may not behave as expected.

% Problem statement: Problem is a practical one, not a theoretical one.
% Ordinary transformations may be correct if used on their own (according to Stevens), but in context of a transformation network, when other transformation have modified the "target" model as well, they do not lead to a consistent result anymore, i.e., they are not correct.
% Start with example of duplicated creation and overwrite.

\mnote{Unidirectional rules in transformation languages}
Using existing transformation languages, the defined transformations will, however, not follow the definition of a synchronizing transformation.
Transformation languages usually allow the specification of unidirectional consistency preservation rules, i.e., rules that restore consistency by updating one model if the other was modified.
Even if transformation languages allow bidirectional specifications, they still derive unidirectional consistency preservation rules from such a specification, such as forward and backward transformation (which may be incremental or not) derived from \glspl{TGG} rules~\cite{leblebici2014IncrementalTGGSurvey-GTVMT}.
In the following, we refer to such transformations as \emph{ordinary transformations} and give a more precise definition of them later on.
Synchronizing transformation, as we assume in transformation networks, are able to process changes made in both models and, in turn, also produce changes for both models.
This is an inevitable property in transformation networks, because both models involved in a transformation may have been modified due to different sequences of transformations having modified both of them.
The case that developers modify multiple models concurrently is sometimes also referred to as \emph{synchronization}, although the term is sometimes even used for the simple case of incremental updates.
If we consider that scenario, we will refer to it as \emph{concurrent editing} to avoid confusion.

\mnote{Ordinary transformations as synchronizing ones}
In this chapter, we aim to close this gap between synchronizing transformations as required in transformation networks and ordinary transformations with unidirectional consistency preservation rules used by transformation languages.
We investigate which requirements such an ordinary transformation has to fulfill to emulate a synchronizing transformation and thus be used in a transformation network.
This chapter thus constitutes our contribution \autoref{contrib:correctness:synchronization}, which consists of four subordinate contributions: a discussion of the formal basis for the gap between synchronizing and ordinary transformations; a discussion of different strategies to combine unidirectional consistency preservation rules of ordinary transformations to emulate a synchronizing transformation; a derivation of requirements to ordinary transformations to be synchronizing; and finally techniques to ensure that ordinary transformations fulfill these requirements.
It answers the following research question:

\mnote{Benefits due to reusability}
The benefit of enabling the definition of ordinary transformations that can be used as synchronizing ones instead of providing an approach or language for the specification of synchronizing transformations is that existing and well-researched transformation languages and knowledge about them can be reused.
Additionally, it reduces the complexity, because the definition of two unidirectional consistency preservation rules is less cumbersome than the definition of a single synchronizing transformation, which has to consider all possible combinations of changes in two models.
We will see that this is founded by the insight that only few combinations of changes are problematic and have to be considered explicitly.

\mnote{Publication of contributions}
We have already published parts of the contributions in this chapter in \cite{klare2018docsym} and \cite{klare2019icmt}.
The identification of essential issues when constructing synchronizing transformations from ordinary transformations defined in existing transformation languages has already been discussed in \cite{klare2018docsym}.
In the Master's thesis of \textcite{syma2018ma}, which was supervised by the author of this thesis, several issues in transformation networks have been identified, and for the category of changes arising from the combination of unidirectional transformation specifications a constructive solution has been proposed.
We have published that work in \cite{klare2019icmt} and present the results especially in \autoref{chap:synchronization:achieving}.
