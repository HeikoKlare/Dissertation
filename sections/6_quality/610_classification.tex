\mnote{Quality property dimensions}
In the previous chapters, we have discussed how correctness of transformation networks can be achieved under the assumption of independent development and modular reuse of the individual transformations.
Artifacts of the software development process, and thus also transformation networks, have, however, further relevant properties than functional correctness.
Other properties especially concern the quality of artifacts regarding several dimensions, as also defined by ISO standard 25010~\cite{iso25010}.
For the operation of a piece of software, besides functionality also its performance, usability, reliability, and security are relevant, whereas for its development especially its maintainability and portability are of interest~\cite[Tab.~2]{iso25010}.

\mnote{Focus on maintainability}
These dimensions of quality properties are directly related to the stakeholders for which they are relevant.
While most property dimensions are related to the operation of a system, including a transformation network, and are thus relevant for users, i.e., for the people developing a system whose artifacts are kept consistent with a transformation network (see \autoref{chap:networks:specification_process}), especially maintainability is important those who develop and maintain a transformation network~\cite[Tab.~2]{iso25010}.
Although all these properties are relevant and have to be considered when developing transformation networks, we explicitly put the focus on those that are relevant for developers of transformations and transformation networks (see \autoref{chap:introduction:objective:benefits}).
Thus, in the following, we particularly focus on properties regarding \emph{maintainability} of a transformation network in addition to its functionality.

\mnote{Topology effects on properties}
In our motivation in~\autoref{chap:introduction}, we have derived several assumptions regarding the process of transformation network construction.
In particular, we have identified independent development and modular reuse of transformations to be essential assumptions, which directly imply that consistency relations may be preserved transitively and repeatedly across different paths of transformations, thus inducing a dense graph of transformations.
Since different qualities properties are highly dependent on the topology of a transformation network, we aim to identify these dependencies and thus discuss which topologies of transformation networks can be distinguished, independent from the initial assumptions that we have made.
We then discuss how these topologies influence quality properties and identify trade-offs between these properties, especially concerning functional correctness and reusability.
Instead of assuming modular reuse and then deriving how to achieve functional correctness, as it was the goal of the previous chapters, we consider topologies with inherent correctness properties and investigate how to improve quality properties, such as their independent reuse.

% Software has more properties than functional correctness.
% Software product quality can be measured in several dimensions, concerning functionality, performance, usability, reliability, security, maintainability and so on~\cite{iso25010}.
% Further properties in addition to correctness;
% Properties: Modularity, Independence, Evolvability, Universality, Correctness, Comprehensibility (last property has two dimension: comprehensibility of transformations and comprehensibility of their execution (errors));
% --> Discuss such properties

% We started with assumptions directly leading to dense graphs, namely independent development and modular reuse.
% %So we tried to find universal, correct and comprehensible strategy.
% Now we turn around and consider which different topologies can be distinguished and find how they influence properties. 
% See that there are trade-offs between properties, such as modularity and correctness.
% By now, we assumed modularity (for modular reuse) and tried to achieve correctness. Now we turn around and start with correct and comprehensible specifications and try to achieve modularity in them.

% 1. We require modularity/independence by assumption -> dense graphs by assumption --> find how to achieve correctness and comprehensibility (in previous part)
% 2. Lets start with trees and try to find a way of achieving modularity and independence by properly specifying trees.

\mnote{Subordinate contributions}
This chapter thus constitutes our contribution \autoref{contrib:quality:topologies}, which consists of two subordinate contributions: a discussion of quality properties and their manifestation in transformation networks; and a classification of transformation network topologies with a discussion about their impact on properties.
It answers the following research question:

\researchquestionrepeat{rq:quality:properties}

\mnote{Benefits of contributions}
With the insights in this chapter, transformation developers and users become aware of further quality properties of transformation networks besides correctness.
They understand how the topology of a network affects these properties and, thus, between which of them trade-off decisions for their improvement have to be made.

\mnote{Publication of contributions}
Parts of the contributions in this chapter have been published in previous work~\owncite{klare2018docsym}.
This especially concerns the identification of general relations between topologies and quality properties of transformation networks, as well as the implication of trade-offs between these properties.
