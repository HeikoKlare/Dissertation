TO BE WRITTEN

Most evaluation results and prototypical implementation performed with and added to the \vitruv framework.
Can be replicated with the framework state at the time of submission of this thesis.
Given by version 0.3.0 of the framework and dependent projects (list here).
Given by explicit reproduction package (link), which sets up exactly that framework version and other projects using Docker to allow long-term replicability.

Results should also be reproducible with the current framework and dependent project versions, but the framework behavior may change and the case studies may be developed further, such that the absolute result values will differ, although the same conclusion should be derivable from them.
