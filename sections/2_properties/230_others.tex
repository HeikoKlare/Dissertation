\ection{Consistency Types}
Structural, behavioral, quality

Map to decidability (Turing completeness)

Discuss pragmatic distinction vs. decidability distinction




\section{Roles}
* Define the process and roles:
** Domain expert
** Transformation developer
** Transformation network developer
** Transformation user
** Multiplicities
* Refer to Dagstuhl report with Mattias
* We call the users of transformation "engineers" (do we?) and the developers "domain experts"?


\section{Processes}


\todo{Discuss different scenarios: 
1. Put together transformations (COTS) and find out what is wrong or achieve that they work together
2. Develop transformations concurrently and find out whether they work together on-the-finally
}

\todoDiss{Discuss different benefits / scenarios more clearly, especially second benefit / application scenario: User define relations and wants on-the-fly feedback on compatibility to other existing relations, rather then a posteriori checking}
